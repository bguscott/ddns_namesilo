# ddns_namesilo
Automated NameSilo DNS A record update with current IP. Run on a machine on your network and it will auto-update NameSilo DNS records and subdomains with your current IP. If a subdomain is provided that doesn't exist, it's created in the process.

Just update the script with your NameSilo API key, desired domain or subdomain names, and run the script using cron.

    * `python2.7 -m ensurepip`
    * `python2.7 -m pip install requests`
    * `python2.7 -m pip install â€“-upgrade pip`
* xml module
